# Student Performance Analysis

This project explores a dataset of students' academic performance using Python. It aims to identify key factors influencing student scores and visualize trends using various data analysis techniques.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset
[Student Performance Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)

## 🚀 What This Project Does
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation heatmaps and score distributions
- Visual comparison of gender, parental education, and test preparation on performance

## 📷 Sample Visualizations
- Histograms of reading/writing/math scores
- Heatmaps of feature correlations
- Boxplots comparing performance by category

## 🧠 Future Work
- Add predictive ML model (Linear Regression or Random Forest)
- Deploy with Streamlit or Flask (optional)
